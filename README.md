# menkar
Menkar is (will be) a dependently typed programming language supporting the following features:

* implicit arguments in the sense of Agda,
* [instance arguments](https://doi.org/10.1145/2034574.2034796) in the sense of Agda,
* support for multimode modality systems with type/term differentiation,
* support for context exponentiation (for working with [tiny](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tiny+object) objects),
* internal presheaf operators,
* erasure of irrelevant subterms,
* subtyping (very long term),
* pseudopolymorphism for universe levels, modes and modalities (pseudoparameters must be instantiated before type checking).
