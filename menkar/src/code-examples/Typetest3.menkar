/*
Mumbling about original functionality of smart eliminations:
------------------------------------------------------------
A could be an implicit function outputting stuff of universe type. Hence, its type is not resolved.
Then the type of x is a smart elimination that cannot be computed, and is represented as a meta.
Then the _ is not resolved either, because metas are only resolved against WHNFs.
